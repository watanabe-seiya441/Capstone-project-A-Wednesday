The today is about Turkey’s violation of the Exclusive Economic Zone of (EEZ) with the Barbaros seismic research vessel. Turkey’s position for the reunification of , which must – according to the Annan Plan – be based on the agreement for a bizonal, bicommunal settlement, has remained unchanged for decades and was reiterated yesterday by Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu. But over the years that Nicosia was promoting the utilization of natural gas reserves in ’s EEZ, Ankara’s objections were limited to rhetoric. What changed that was the announcement that President Nicos Anastasiades and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras would visit Egypt together in order to discuss a trilateral agreement on the EEZ issue. The two leaders have an indisputable right to promote the interests of their respective countries but the introduction of a third party in the mining of natural resources in the Eastern Mediterranean basin was obviously something Ankara could never accept given the strained relations between Turkey and Egypt right now over the Muslim Brotherhood. Moreover, the fact that Samaras is prime minister has made Ankara more wary of the Greek government’s intentions and its skepticism was only heightened by talk of a unilateral designation of the Greek EEZ – as is Greece’s right, of course. The idea was introduced by Samaras but later abandoned when it was deemed unwise. The Barbaros is currently sailing in Cypriot EEZ . The president is issuing demarches in all directions.

        "title": "Dangerous times in the Aegean and Cyprus",
        "body": "The concept of gray zones (the claim that the sovereignty of a number of islands and islets in the Aegean is undetermined) was a novel idea that Turkey came up with 20 years ago. Whenever Athens made a request regarding the islands or rocky outcrops that Turkey had on its list, the answer was always very vague: “Anything that is not clearly included the bilateral agreements that set out Greece’s borders with other countries.” At first, many people thought this was a bargaining chip that Ankara would trade as part of a grand bargain. They were wrong. The failure to settle differences between Greece and Turkey gave Ankara the opportunity to add more issues to the agenda. Over time, these have become permanent and ever-expanding. Currently, Turkey considers significant parts of the Aegean to be gray zones. This includes islands that have been inhabited for decades. It is questioning Greek sovereignty through its actions, by the frequent presence of naval vessels in Greek and overflights by fighter jets. Over the last few months, it has being doing this more systematically and openly. Greece’s approach has also changed. The doctrine that existed in the wake of the Imia in 1996, when the two countries almost went to war, was based around not building up tension following various incidents and maintaining a low profile. The current government, however, is following a different tactic, with visits by officials to islands that are in Turkey’s sights. Often, the temperature rises, and sometimes it reaches dangerous levels. While this is going on, Turkey is trying to asphyxiate Kastellorizo in order to deny Greece’s claim to a continental shelf that borders ’s. A dangerous situation is also playing out in . The Turks are trying to impose the concept of gray zones there as well. July (when a new round of drilling for hydrocarbons is due to begin off ) promises to be a difficult month. Ankara will attempt before then to intimidate the companies that plan to start drilling or try to obstruct them if they are not scared off by threats. The international community can see the danger and will make another, possibly final, effort to solve the issue. Things are going to get serious. All this will be taking place within an uncertain and unpredictable international environment.",
